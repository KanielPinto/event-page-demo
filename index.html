              From the grace of contemporary to the swag of hip-hop, from the
              melodies of acapella to the beats of jazz, we&#39;ve got it all
              covered! WPA is the platform that gives your passion wings! If the
              grit, the sweat, the gruelling hours spent to get just a single
              piece of choreography right and the love of making music keeps you
              going then WPA is definitely your place.This year our vision is to
              incorporate inclusivity irrespective of the various barriers and
              bring out the best in everyone. We aim to nurture talent and would
              go all out to provide a platform for all the willing ones.
              Bringing in a new flavour along with carrying forward the legacy
              of WPA would be our mantra!

              Performing Arts department of Malhar 2023 aims to promote the
              beats of tabla, the mellifluous notes of the sitar, the rhythmic
              footwork of Kathak and the energetic beats of Bhangra. We are
              determined to continue the rich legacy of Indian classical and
              folk art forms. By fusing the traditional art forms with a little
              Bollywood tadka, our vision is to organise the grandest and the
              most entertaining events in Malhar!

            <h2>Literary Arts</h2>
            <p class="description">
              Literary Arts has always had a certain perception: people expect
              it to be a space only for a niche audience. My claim is not that
              this isn&#39;t true, but that it&#39;s incomplete. Literary arts
              is so much more — it is an expression, a catharsis, and, more
              importantly, a rediscovery of yourself. Through this department
              and Malhar &#39;23, I aim to break this stereotype and simply
              redefine what LA means. With an incredible team of OGs and
              Volunteers, I&#39;m positive that we can achieve this goal. And if
              you think that Literary Arts is &#39;boring&#39;, we can&#39;t
              wait to show you what we have in store.

            <h2>Crossover</h2>
            <p class="description">
              Malhar is about many aspects, like cooperation, collaboration and
              a collected set of efforts striving towards a common goal.
              Crossover events fit into all the above mentioned adjectives and
              is best defined as a fusion of talents. The Crossover events carry
              forward the legacy of Malhar by proving that despite having
              different departments, there is nothing better than when they come
              together to create a spectacle.
